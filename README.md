In this article, the role of data in Economics is discussed. We look at two articles -- one from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the other from the Mercatus Center, an Economics think tank. Article 2 poses a few challanges to the ideas proposed in article 1.

## Article 1
In the IMF's article, "[The Economics of Data](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2019/09/23/the-economics-of-data#:~:text=Data%20has%20become%20a%20key,including%20oil%2C%20in%20important%20ways.)", the author explores the rapidly emerging importance of data in Economics. If we take a look at the largest companies today based on market capital, we can see that the top companies are data-related. That is, data is a pillar or a center to these companies.

Since there is more access to data, data can be used in Economic to achieve more efficient outcomes. Typically, a country's economic output/income is based on key variables such as capital, labor, technology, investments. and so forth. Today, data can be classified as one of those key variables for achieving economic growth.

## Article 2
The article by the Mercatus Center, titled "[The Challenges of Producing Economic Data for the 21st Century](https://www.mercatus.org/research/federal-testimonies/challenges-producing-economic-data-21st-century)" explores a few of the challanges for data collection and measurement in the world of Economics. In the previous article, we established that data can be used to achieve higher economic growth through proper utilization. Today, in the U.S., many of the Federal Statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are using outdated methods for data collection and analysis which results in poor policy implicaitons.

In order to utilize the data and make sense of the economic activities of individuals and firms, Federal Statistical agencies must mdoernize the data collection proccess, statistical systems, and data dissemination.
